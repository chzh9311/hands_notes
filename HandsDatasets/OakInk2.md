# OakInk2: A Dataset of Bimanual Hands-Object Manipulation in  Complex Task Completion
3 levels of motion:
1. Affordance: a bottle cap secures and unsecures the content
2. Primitive: **mininal** sequence that fulfills the object's affordance
3. Complex task: combination of primitives for long-range and multi-goal manipulation tasks.
## Novel task: Task-aware Motion Fulfillment (TaMF)
* The generation of hand motion sequences that can fulfill given object trajectories conditioned on textual task description.
