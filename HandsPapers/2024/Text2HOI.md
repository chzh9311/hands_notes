# Text2HOI: Text-guided 3D Motion Generation for Hand-Object Interaction
## Motivation
Text provides the necessary context for HOI generation.
Challenge: lack of data
â†’ Object contact map generation & hand-object motion generation.

## Method
### Contact map generation

1. compute the radius of smallest bounding sphere of the object mesh $s_{obj}$. The context map is represented by binary values at N sampled points.
2. Supervised by Cross-entropy, dice loss, and KL divergence.
### Motion is generated by a diffusion model
$$x_0 = f^{THOI}(x_t, t, c)$$
The condition $c$ includes the text features, contact map, object scale, and object features.
