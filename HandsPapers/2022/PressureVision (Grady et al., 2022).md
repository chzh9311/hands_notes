# PressureVision: Estimating Hand Pressure from a Single RGB Image
## Motivation
1. Physical sensors alter the contact surface, and changes the manipulation
2. Explore the feasibility of estimating pressure using RGB images.
## Method
PressuireVisionNet is an encoder-decoder architecture
RGB image -> pressure map
## Dataset

Better Version: PressureVision++ (WACV, 2024)
+ added contact modelling
+ added domain adaptation
A new dataset is also formed with GT-labelled dataset and weakly-labelled datasets.
