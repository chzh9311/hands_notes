# EgoPCA: A New Framework for Egocentric Hand-Object Interaction Understanding
## Motivation
Current Ego-HOI learning exists 3 weaknesses:
1. Gap between first- and third-personal views
2. finetuning one shared pre-trained model for all downstream tasks is inefficient;
A novel basic framework for Ego-HOI learning:
1. new pretrain and test sets;
2. A new baseline model;
3. All-for-one customized mechanism
