# A2J-Transformer: Anchor-to-Joint Transformer Network for 3D Interacting Hand Pose Estimation from a Single RGB Image
## Motivation
Challenges to address:
1. inter- and intra-occlusions;
2. similar appearance between hands;
Key: the estimator should be aware of both **local details** and **global context**
