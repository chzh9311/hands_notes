# TriDi: Trilateral Diffusion of 3D Humans, Objects, and Interactions
![[Pasted image 20250611110419.png]]
The tasks are implemented in one unified framework by adjusting the timestamps ($t^\mathcal{H}, t^{\mathcal{O}}, t^\mathcal{I}$). They are set to 0 for condition and $T$ for target.
*It is similar to the diffusion timestamp.* 0 for clean state and $T$ for total noise.
