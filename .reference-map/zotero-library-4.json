In this class-incremental learning (CIL) setting, while incrementally registering the new classes, we do not have access to the training samples (i.e. data-free) of the already known classes due to privacy. Existing DFCIL methods primarily focus on various forms of knowledge distillation for model inversion to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Unlike SOTA methods, we delve deeper into the choice of the best samples for inversion. Inspired by the well-grounded theory of max-margin classification, we find that the best samples tend to lie close to the approximate decision boundary within a reasonable margin. To this end, we propose BOAT-MI -- a simple and effective boundary-aware prototypical sampling mechanism for model inversion for DFCIL. Our sampling scheme outperforms SOTA methods significantly on two 3D skeleton gesture datasets, the publicly available SHREC 2017, and EgoGesture3D -- which we extract from a publicly available RGBD dataset.

  {"id":"ambergOptimalStepNonrigid2007","abstract":"We show how to extend the ICP framework to nonrigid registration, while retaining the convergence properties of the original algorithm. The resulting optimal step nonrigid ICP framework allows the use of different regularisations, as long as they have an adjustable stiffness parameter. The registration loops over a series of decreasing stiffness weights, and incrementally deforms the template towards the target, recovering the whole range of global and local deformations. To find the optimal deformation for a given stiffness, optimal iterative closest point steps are used. Preliminary correspondences are estimated by a nearest-point search. Then the optimal deformation of the template for these fixed correspondences and the active stiffness is calculated. Afterwards the process continues with new correspondences found by searching from the displaced template vertices. We present an algorithm using a locally affine regularisation which assigns an affine transformation to each vertex and minimises the difference in the transformation of neighbouring vertices. It is shown that for this regularisation the optimal deformation for fixed correspondences and fixed stiffness can be determined exactly and efficiently. The method succeeds for a wide range of initial conditions, and handles missing data robustly. It is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other algorithms using synthetic examples and real world data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Amberg","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Romdhani","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Vetter","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"ambergOptimalStepNonrigid2007","container-title":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383165","event-title":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","ISSN":"1063-6919","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",6]]},"page":"1-8","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Optimal Step Nonrigid ICP Algorithms for Surface Registration","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4270190"},

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the prior-to-contact grasping kinematics of the same object vary as a result of different goals of the person grasping it. Subjects were requested to reach toward and grasp a bottle filled with water, and then complete one of the following tasks: (1) Grasp it without performing any subsequent action; (2) Lift and throw it; (3) Pour the water into a container; (4) Place it accurately on a target area; (5) Pass it to another person. We measured the angular excursions at both metacarpal-phalangeal (mcp) and proximal interphalangeal (pip) joints of all digits, and abduction angles of adjacent digit pairs by means of resistive sensors embedded in a glove. The results showed that the presence and the nature of the task to be performed following grasping affect the positioning of the fingers during the reaching phase. We contend that a one-to-one association between a sensory stimulus and a motor response does not capture all the aspects involved in grasping.

  {"id":"aziziOcclusionHandling3D","abstract":"Understanding human behavior fundamentally relies on accurate 3D human pose estimation. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently shown promising advancements, delivering state-of-the-art performance with rather lightweight architectures. In the context of graph-structured data, leveraging the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix for positional encoding is effective. Yet, the approach does not specify how to handle scenarios where edges in the input graph are missing. To this end, we propose a novel positional encoding technique, PerturbPE, that extracts consistent and regular components from the eigenbasis. Our method involves applying multiple perturbations and taking their average to extract the consistent and regular component from the eigenbasis. PerturbPE leverages the Rayleigh-Schrodinger Perturbation Theorem (RSPT) for calculating the perturbed eigenvectors. Employing this labeling technique enhances the robustness and generalizability of the model. Our results support our theoretical findings, e.g. our experimental analysis observed a performance enhancement of up to 12% on the Human3.6M dataset in instances where occlusion resulted in the absence of one edge. Furthermore, our novel approach significantly enhances performance in scenarios where two edges are missing, setting a new benchmark for state-of-the-art.","author":[{"family":"Azizi","given":"Niloofar"},{"family":"Fayyaz","given":"Mohsen"},{"family":"Bischof","given":"Horst"}],"citation-key":"aziziOcclusionHandling3D","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Occlusion Handling in 3D Human Pose Estimation with Perturbed Positional Encoding","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"castielloNeuroscienceGrasping2005","abstract":"Considerable advances in our knowledge of human and non-human primate grasping control have been made during the past decade, using a combination of behavioural, neuroimaging and electrophysiological approaches. As a result, the neural circuitry and mechanisms of grasping are being elucidated. However, few attempts have been made to reconcile findings across species.Various experiments using kinematic techniques indicate that the mechanics of grasping in humans vary depending on object attributes such as fragility, size, shape, texture and weight. By contrast, kinematic studies in monkeys have been limited and confined to the testing of an object's size and shape.Single-unit physiology studies indicate that grasping might be represented by neurons in a network of brain areas, including the motor, premotor and parietal cortices. Because these areas contain representations of hand actions and the structures of objects, it has been suggested that their integrity might be crucial for successful grasping.Findings from patients with brain damage who have difficulty in grasping objects are difficult to reconcile with neurophysiological findings, as the patients' lesions are confined to regions that, in monkeys, do not seem to be involved in grasping-related visuomotor transformations.Recent positron emission tomography and functional MRI studies in humans have indicated possible human homologues of the brain regions that seem to be involved in grasping in monkeys. However, because of the difficulty of studying real grasping in the neuroimaging environment, many laboratories have taken to studying rather unnatural tasks. So, there are inconsistencies in the experimental protocols that make these results difficult to compare and interpret.One consistent region that has been identified as being involved in grasping tasks is the human homologue of the monkey anterior intraparietal area. However, in most of the studies that show such activation, participants were constrained to a single type of grasp (a precision grip), which raises the question of whether different grasping patterns are represented in this area.Contextual information that is involved in the unfolding of the grasping action (for example, using the same object for different purposes) has been largely neglected. A fundamental step is to uncover whether and to what extent contextual factors affect movement organization in humans and monkeys.To make progress in this field, it would be useful to implement a coordinated series of experiments in which similar protocols are applied to monkeys and humans, using various techniques. This multi-pronged approach should ideally combine functional imaging with MRI-compatible electrophysiological and kinematic recordings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Castiello","given":"Umberto"}],"citation-key":"castielloNeuroscienceGrasping2005","container-title":"Nature Reviews Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Neurosci","DOI":"10.1038/nrn1744","ISSN":"1471-0048","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",9]]},"language":"en","license":"2005 Springer Nature Limited","page":"726-736","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The neuroscience of grasping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1744","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"chaText2HOITextguided3D2024","abstract":"This paper introduces the first text-guided work for generating the sequence of hand-object interaction in 3D. The main challenge arises from the lack of labeled data where existing ground-truth datasets are nowhere near generalizable in interaction type and object category which inhibits the modeling of diverse 3D hand-object interaction with the correct physical implication (e.g. contacts and semantics) from text prompts. To address this challenge we propose to decompose the interaction generation task into two subtasks: hand-object contact generation; and hand-object motion generation. For contact generation a VAE-based network takes as input a text and an object mesh and generates the probability of contacts between the surfaces of hands and the object during the interaction. The network learns a variety of local geometry structure of diverse objects that is independent of the objects' category and thus it is applicable to general objects. For motion generation a Transformer-based diffusion model utilizes this 3D contact map as a strong prior for generating physically plausible hand-object motion as a function of text prompts by learning from the augmented labeled dataset; where we annotate text labels from many existing 3D hand and object motion data. Finally we further introduce a hand refiner module that minimizes the distance between the object surface and hand joints to improve the temporal stability of the object-hand contacts and to suppress the penetration artifacts. In the experiments we demonstrate that our method can generate more realistic and diverse interactions compared to other baseline methods. We also show that our method is applicable to unseen objects. We will release our model and newly labeled data as a strong foundation for future research.

Previous methods suffer from inefficient category-level pose feature extraction which leads to low accuracy and inference speed. To tackle this problem, we propose a fast shape-based network (FS-Net) with efficient category-level feature extraction for 6D pose estimation. First, we design an orientation aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent feature extraction. The learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift and object size thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of the 3D graph convolution. Then, to efficiently decode category-level rotation information from the latent feature, we propose a novel decoupled rotation mechanism that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation information. Meanwhile, we estimate translation and size by two residuals, which are the difference between the mean of object points and ground truth translation, and the difference between the mean size of the category and ground truth size, respectively. Finally, to increase the generalization ability of FS-Net, we propose an online box-cage based 3D deformation mechanism to augment the training data. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both category- and instance-level 6D object pose estimation.

As for texture modeling, we propose a self-occlusion-aware shading field (SelF). In SelF, drivable anchors are paved on the MANO-HD surface to record albedo information under a wide variety of hand poses. Moreover, directed soft occupancy is designed to describe the ray-to-surface relation, which is leveraged to generate an illumination field for the disentanglement of pose-independent albedo and pose-dependent illumination. Trained from monocular video data, our HandAvatar can perform free-pose hand animation and rendering while at the same time achieving superior appearance fidelity. We also demonstrate that HandAvatar provides a route for hand appearance editing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Xingyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Baoyuan"},{"family":"Shum","given":"Heung-Yeung"}],"citation-key":"chenHandAvatarFreePose2023","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"8683-8693","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"Hand Avatar: Free-Pose Hand Animation and Rendering From Monocular Video","title-short":"Hand Avatar","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_Hand_Avatar_Free-Pose_Hand_Animation_and_Rendering_From_Monocular_Video_CVPR_2023_paper.html"},

  {"id":"chenTrackingReconstructingHand2023","abstract":"In this work, we tackle the challenging task of jointly tracking hand object poses and reconstructing their shapes from depth point cloud sequences in the wild, given the initial poses at frame 0. We for the first time propose a point cloud-based hand joint tracking network, HandTrackNet, to estimate the inter-frame hand joint motion. Our HandTrackNet proposes a novel hand pose canonicalization module to ease the tracking task, yielding accurate and robust hand joint tracking. Our pipeline then reconstructs the full hand via converting the predicted hand joints into a MANO hand. For object tracking, we devise a simple yet effective module that estimates the object SDF from the first frame and performs optimization-based tracking. Finally, a joint optimization step is adopted to perform joint hand and object reasoning, which alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguity and further refines the hand pose. During training, the whole pipeline only sees purely synthetic data, which are synthesized with sufficient variations and by depth simulation for the ease of generalization. The whole pipeline is pertinent to the generalization gaps and thus directly transferable to real in-the-wild data. We evaluate our method on two real hand object interaction datasets, e.g. HO3D and DexYCB, without any fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art depth-based hand and object pose estimation and tracking methods, running at a frame rate of 9 FPS.

Due to the large memory overhead and slow inference speed, it is difficult to deploy such models for practical use. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer encoder-decoder architecture for 3D human mesh reconstruction from a single image, called FastMETRO. We identify the performance bottleneck in the encoder-based transformers is caused by the token design which introduces high complexity interactions among input tokens. We disentangle the interactions via an encoder-decoder architecture, which allows our model to demand much fewer parameters and shorter inference time. In addition, we impose the prior knowledge of human body’s morphological relationship via attention masking and mesh upsampling operations, which leads to faster convergence with higher accuracy. Our FastMETRO improves the Pareto-front of accuracy and efficiency, and clearly outperforms image-based methods on Human3.6M and 3DPW.

  {"id":"choDenseHandObjectHOGraspNet","abstract":"Existing datasets for 3D hand-object interaction are limited either in the data cardinality, data variations in interaction scenarios, or the quality of annotations. In this work, we present a comprehensive new training dataset for hand-object interaction called HOGraspNet. It is the only real dataset that captures full grasp taxonomies, providing grasp annotation and wide intraclass variations. Using grasp taxonomies as atomic actions, their space and time combinatorial can represent complex hand activities around objects. We select 22 rigid objects from the YCB dataset and 8 other compound objects using shape and size taxonomies, ensuring coverage of all hand grasp configurations. The dataset includes diverse hand shapes from 99 participants aged 10 to 74, continuous video frames, and a 1.5M RGB-Depth of sparse frames with annotations. It offers labels for 3D hand and object meshes, 3D keypoints, contact maps, and grasp labels. Accurate hand and object 3D meshes are obtained by fitting the hand parametric model (MANO) and the hand implicit function (HALO) to multi-view RGBD frames, with the MoCap system only for objects. Note that HALO fitting does not require any parameter tuning, enabling scalability to the dataset’s size with comparable accuracy to MANO. We evaluate HOGraspNet on relevant tasks: grasp classification and 3D hand pose estimation. The result shows performance variations based on grasp type and object class, indicating the potential importance of the interaction space captured by our dataset.

This paper focuses on a new problem not explored so far, consisting in predicting how a human would grasp one or several objects, given a single RGB image of these objects. This is a problem with enormous potential in e.g. augmented reality, robotics or prosthetic design. In order to predict feasible grasps, we need to understand the semantic content of the image, its geometric structure and all potential interactions with a hand physical model. To this end, we introduce a generative model that jointly reasons in all these levels and 1) regresses the 3D shape and pose of the objects in the scene; 2) estimates the grasp types; and 3) reﬁnes the 51-DoF of a 3D hand model that minimize a graspability loss. To train this model we build the YCB-Affordance dataset, that contains more than 133k images of 21 objects in the YCB-Video dataset [69]. We have annotated these images with more than 28M plausible 3D human grasps according to a 33-class taxonomy. A thorough evaluation in synthetic and real images shows that our model can robustly predict realistic grasps, even in cluttered scenes with multiple objects in close contact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Corona","given":"Enric"},{"family":"Pumarola","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Alenya","given":"Guillem"},{"family":"Moreno-Noguer","given":"Francesc"},{"family":"Rogez","given":"Gregory"}],"citation-key":"coronaGanHandPredictingHuman2020","container-title":"2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00508","event-place":"Seattle, WA, USA","event-title":"2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","ISBN":"978-1-72817-168-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html","page":"5030-5040","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Seattle, WA, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"GanHand: Predicting Human Grasp Affordances in Multi-Object Scenes","title-short":"GanHand","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156512/"},

For a 3D point in the hand local coordinate, our model predicts the color and the signed distance with respect to each hand bone independently, and then combines the per-bone predictions using predicted skinning weights.

  {"id":"fanLearningDisambiguateStrongly2021","abstract":"In natural conversation and interaction, our hands often overlap or are in contact with each other. Due to the homogeneous appearance of hands, this makes estimating the 3D pose of interacting hands from images difficult. In this paper we demonstrate that self-similarity, and the resulting ambiguities in assigning pixel observations to the respective hands and their parts, is a major cause of the final 3D pose error. Motivated by this insight, we propose DIGIT, a novel method for estimating the 3D poses of two interacting hands from a single monocular image. The method consists of two interwoven branches that process the input imagery into a per-pixel semantic part segmentation mask and a visual feature volume. In contrast to prior work, we do not decouple the segmentation from the pose estimation stage, but rather leverage the per-pixel probabilities directly in the downstream pose estimation task. To do so, the part probabilities are merged with the visual features and processed via fully-convolutional layers. We experimentally show that the proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the InterHand2.6M [33] dataset. We provide detailed ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method and to provide insights into how the modelling of pixel ownership affects 3D hand pose estimation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Zicong"},{"family":"Spurr","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Kocabas","given":"Muhammed"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Siyu"},{"family":"Black","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Hilliges","given":"Otmar"}],"citation-key":"fanLearningDisambiguateStrongly2021","container-title":"2021 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)","DOI":"10.1109/3DV53792.2021.00011","event-title":"2021 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)","ISSN":"2475-7888","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"page":"1-10","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Learning To Disambiguate Strongly Interacting Hands via Probabilistic Per-Pixel Part Segmentation","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9665878"},
  {"id":"fuDeformerDynamicFusion2023","abstract":"Accurately estimating 3D hand pose is crucial for understanding how humans interact with the world. Despite remarkable progress, existing methods often struggle to generate plausible hand poses when the hand is heavily occluded or blurred. In videos, the movements of the hand allow us to observe various parts of the hand that may be occluded or blurred in a single frame. To adaptively leverage the visual clue before and after the occlusion or blurring for robust hand pose estimation, we propose the Deformer: a framework that implicitly reasons about the relationship between hand parts within the same image (spatial dimension) and different timesteps (temporal dimension). We show that a naive application of the transformer self-attention mechanism is not sufficient because motion blur or occlusions in certain frames can lead to heavily distorted hand features and generate imprecise keys and queries. To address this challenge, we incorporate a Dynamic Fusion Module into Deformer, which predicts the deformation of the hand and warps the hand mesh predictions from nearby frames to explicitly support the current frame estimation. Furthermore, we have observed that errors are unevenly distributed across different hand parts, with vertices around fingertips having disproportionately higher errors than those around the palm. We mitigate this issue by introducing a new loss function called maxMSE that automatically adjusts the weight of every vertex to focus the model on critical hand parts. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10%, and is more robust to occlusions (over 14%).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Fu","given":"Qichen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xingyu"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Niebles","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Kitani","given":"Kris M."}],"citation-key":"fuDeformerDynamicFusion2023","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"23600-23611","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"Deformer: Dynamic Fusion Transformer for Robust Hand Pose Estimation","title-short":"Deformer","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Fu_Deformer_Dynamic_Fusion_Transformer_for_Robust_Hand_Pose_Estimation_ICCV_2023_paper.html"},

Towards this goal, we collected RGB-D video sequences comprised of more than 100K frames of 45 daily hand action categories, involving 26 different objects in several hand configurations. To obtain hand pose annotations, we used our own mo-cap system that automatically infers the 3D location of each of the 21 joints of a hand model via 6 magnetic sensors and inverse kinematics. Additionally, we recorded the 6D object poses and provide 3D object models for a subset of hand-object interaction sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark that enables the study of first-person hand actions with the use of 3D hand poses. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of RGB-D and pose-based action recognition by 18 baselines/state-of-the-art approaches. The impact of using appearance features, poses, and their combinations are measured, and the different training/testing protocols are evaluated. Finally, we assess how ready the 3D hand pose estimation field is when hands are severely occluded by objects in egocentric views and its influence on action recognition. From the results, we see clear benefits of using hand pose as a cue for action recognition compared to other data modalities.

  {"id":"guMambaLinearTimeSequence2024","abstract":"Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gu","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Dao","given":"Tri"}],"citation-key":"guMambaLinearTimeSequence2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2312.00752","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"number":"arXiv:2312.00752","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces","title-short":"Mamba","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752"},

We reconstruct the object shape and track its poses independently within each segment, then merge all the segments before performing a global optimization.

Specifically, for a 3D query point in camera frustum and its pixel-aligned image feature, NVF, represented by a Multi-Layer Perceptron, regresses: (i) its signed distance to the hand surface; (ii) a set of 4D offset vectors (1D voting weight and 3D directional vector to each hand joint). Following a vote-casting scheme, 4D offset vectors from near-surface points are selected to calculate the 3D hand joint coordinates by a weighted average. Experiments demonstrate that NVF outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on FreiHAND dataset for camera-space 3D hand pose estimation.

  {"id":"iwaseRelightableHandsEfficientNeural2023","abstract":"We present the first neural relighting approach for rendering high-fidelity personalized hands that can be animated in real-time under novel illumination. Our approach adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher learns appearance under a single point light from images captured in a light-stage, allowing us to synthesize hands in arbitrary illuminations but with heavy compute. Using images rendered by the teacher model as training data, an efficient student model directly predicts appearance under natural illuminations in real-time. To achieve generalization, we condition the student model with physics-inspired illumination features such as visibility, diffuse shading, and specular reflections computed on a coarse proxy geometry, maintaining a small computational overhead. Our key insight is that these features have strong correlation with subsequent global light transport effects, which proves sufficient as conditioning data for the neural relighting network.

It requires a large number of human demonstrations for the learning and understanding of plausible and appropriate hand-object interactions. In this work, we present AffordPose, a large-scale dataset of hand-object interactions with affordance-driven hand pose. We first annotate the specific part-level affordance labels for each object, e.g. twist, pull, handle-grasp, etc, instead of the general intents such as use or handover, to indicate the purpose and guide the localization of the hand-object interactions. The fine-grained hand-object interactions reveal the influence of hand-centered affordances on the detailed arrangement of the hand poses, yet also exhibit a certain degree of diversity. We collect a total of 26.7K hand-object interactions, each including the 3D object shape, the part-level affordance label, and the manually adjusted hand poses. The comprehensive data analysis shows the common characteristics and diversity of hand-object interactions per affordance via the parameter statistics and contacting computation.

To address these, we propose to extend A2J-the state-of-the-art depth-based 3D single hand pose estimation method-to RGB domain under interacting hand condition. Our key idea is to equip A2J with strong local-global aware ability to well capture interacting hands' local fine details and global articulated clues among joints jointly. To this end, A2J is evolved under Transformer's non-local encoding-decoding framework to build A2J-Transformer. It holds 3 main advantages over A2J. First, self-attention across local anchor points is built to make them global spatial context aware to better capture joints' articulation clues for resisting occlusion. Secondly, each anchor point is regarded as learnable query with adaptive feature learning for facilitating pattern fitting capacity, instead of having the same local representation with the others. Last but not least, anchor point locates in 3D space instead of 2D as in A2J, to leverage 3D pose prediction. Experiments on challenging InterHand 2.6M demonstrate that, A2J-Transformer can achieve state-of-the-art model-free performance (3.38mm MPJPE advancement in 2-hand case) and can also be applied to depth domain with strong generalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Changlong"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Cunlin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Mingyang"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Jinghong"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Zhiguo"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Joey Tianyi"}],"citation-key":"jiangA2JTransformerAnchortoJointTransformer2023","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"8846-8855","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"A2J-Transformer: Anchor-to-Joint Transformer Network for 3D Interacting Hand Pose Estimation From a Single RGB Image","title-short":"A2J-Transformer","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Jiang_A2J-Transformer_Anchor-to-Joint_Transformer_Network_for_3D_Interacting_Hand_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2023_paper.html"},

In this paper, we propose to generate human grasps given a 3D object in the world. Our key observation is that it is crucial to model the consistency between the hand contact points and object contact regions. That is, we encourage the prior hand contact points to be close to the object surface and the object common contact regions to be touched by the hand at the same time. Based on the hand-object contact consistency, we design novel objectives in training the human grasp generation model and also a new self-supervised task which allows the grasp generation network to be adjusted even during test time. Our experiments show significant improvement in human grasp generation over state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

These approaches can be roughly divided into model-based approaches, which are heavily dependent on the model's parameter space, and model-free approaches, which require large numbers of 3D ground truths to reduce depth ambiguity and struggle in weakly-supervised scenarios. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel probabilistic model to achieve the robustness of model-based approaches and reduced dependence on the model's parameter space of model-free approaches. The proposed probabilistic model incorporates a model-based network as a prior-net to estimate the prior probability distribution of joints and vertices. An Attention-based Mesh Vertices Uncertainty Regression (AMVUR) model is proposed to capture dependencies among vertices and the correlation between joints and mesh vertices to improve their feature representation.

We demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed probabilistic model to be trained in both supervised and weakly-supervised scenarios.

  {"id":"karunratanakulGraspingFieldLearning2020","abstract":"Robotic grasping of house-hold objects has made remarkable progress in recent years. Yet, human grasps are still difficult to synthesize realistically. There are several key reasons: (1) the human hand has many degrees of freedom (more than robotic manipulators); (2) the synthesized hand should conform to the surface of the object; and (3) it should interact with the object in a semantically and physically plausible manner. To make progress in this direction, we draw inspiration from the recent progress on learning-based implicit representations for 3D object reconstruction. Specifically, we propose an expressive representation for human grasp modelling that is efficient and easy to integrate with deep neural networks. Our insight is that every point in a three-dimensional space can be characterized by the signed distances to the surface of the hand and the object, respectively. Consequently, the hand, the object, and the contact area can be represented by implicit surfaces in a common space, in which the proximity between the hand and the object can be modelled explicitly. We name this 3D to 2D mapping as Grasping Field, parameterize it with a deep neural network, and learn it from data. We demonstrate that the proposed grasping field is an effective and expressive representation for human grasp generation. Specifically, our generative model is able to synthesize high-quality human grasps, given only on a 3D object point cloud. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative model compares favorably with a strong baseline and approaches the level of natural human grasps.

  {"id":"liCHORDCategorylevelHandheld2023","abstract":"In daily life, humans utilize hands to manipulate objects. Modeling the shape of objects that are manipulated by the hand is essential for AI to comprehend daily tasks and to learn manipulation skills. However, previous approaches have encountered difficulties in reconstructing the precise shapes of hand-held objects, primarily owing to a deficiency in prior shape knowledge and inadequate data for training. As illustrated, given a particular type of tool, such as a mug, despite its infinite variations in shape and appearance, humans have a limited number of 'effective' modes and poses for its manipulation. This can be attributed to the fact that humans have mastered the shape prior of the 'mug' category, and can quickly establish the corresponding relations between different mug instances and the prior, such as where the rim and handle are located. In light of this, we propose a new method, CHORD, for Category-level Hand-held Object Reconstruction via shape Deformation. CHORD deforms a categorical shape prior for reconstructing the intra-class objects. To ensure accurate reconstruction, we empower CHORD with three types of awareness: appearance, shape, and interacting pose.

  {"id":"liHHMRHolisticHand2024","abstract":"Recent years have witnessed a trend of the deep integration of the generation and reconstruction paradigms. In this paper we extend the ability of controllable generative models for a more comprehensive hand mesh recovery task: direct hand mesh generation inpainting reconstruction and fitting in a single framework which we name as Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery (HHMR). Our key observation is that different kinds of hand mesh recovery tasks can be achieved by a single generative model with strong multimodal controllability and in such a framework realizing different tasks only requires giving different signals as conditions. To achieve this goal we propose an all-in-one diffusion framework based on graph convolution and attention mechanisms for holistic hand mesh recovery. In order to achieve strong control generation capability while ensuring the decoupling of multimodal control signals we map different modalities to a share feature space and apply cross-scale random masking in both modality and feature levels. In this way the correlation between different modalities can be fully exploited during the learning of hand priors. Furthermore we propose Condition-aligned Gradient Guidance to enhance the alignment of the generated model with the control signals which significantly improves the accuracy of the hand mesh reconstruction and fitting. Experiments show that our novel framework can realize multiple hand mesh recovery tasks simultaneously and outperform the existing methods in different tasks which provides more possibilities for subsequent downstream applications including gesture recognition pose generation mesh editing and so on.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Mengcheng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hongwen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuxiang"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Ruizhi"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yebin"}],"citation-key":"liHHMRHolisticHand2024","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"645-654","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"HHMR: Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery by Enhancing the Multimodal Controllability of Graph Diffusion Models","title-short":"HHMR","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Li_HHMR_Holistic_Hand_Mesh_Recovery_by_Enhancing_the_Multimodal_Controllability_CVPR_2024_paper.html"},

To solve occlusion and interaction challenges of two-hand reconstruction, we introduce two novel attention based modules in each upsampling step of the original GCN.

  {"id":"linHarmoniousFeatureLearning2023","abstract":"Joint hand and object pose estimation from a single image is extremely challenging as serious occlusion often occurs when the hand and object interact. Existing approaches typically first extract coarse hand and object features from a single backbone, then further enhance them with reference to each other via interaction modules. However, these works usually ignore that the hand and object are competitive in feature learning, since the backbone takes both of them as foreground and they are usually mutually occluded. In this paper, we propose a novel Harmonious Feature Learning Network (HFL-Net). HFL-Net introduces a new framework that combines the advantages of single- and double-stream backbones: it shares the parameters of the low- and high-level convolutional layers of a common ResNet-50 model for the hand and object, leaving the middle-level layers unshared. This strategy enables the hand and the object to be extracted as the sole targets by the middle-level layers, avoiding their competition in feature learning. The shared high-level layers also force their features to be harmonious, thereby facilitating their mutual feature enhancement. In particular, we propose to enhance the feature of the hand via concatenation with the feature in the same location from the object stream. A subsequent self-attention layer is adopted to deeply fuse the concatenated feature. Experimental results show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the popular HO3D and Dex-YCB databases. Notably, the performance of our model on hand pose estimation even surpasses that of existing works that only perform the single-hand pose estimation task.

SDF enables modeling hand-held objects with arbitrary topology and overcomes the resolution limitations of parametric models, allowing for finer-grained reconstruction. However, directly modeling detailed SDFs from visual clues presents challenges due to depth ambiguity and appearance similarity, especially in cluttered real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine SDF framework for 3D hand-object reconstruction, which leverages the perceptual advantages of RGB-D modality in visual and geometric aspects, to progressively model the implicit field. Specifically, we model a coarse SDF for visual perception of overall scenes. Then, we propose a 3D Point-Aligned Implicit Function (3D PIFu) for fine-level SDF learning, which leverages both local geometric clues and the coarse-level visual priors to capture intricate details. Additionally, we propose a surface-aware efficient reconstruction strategy that sparsely performs SDF query based on the hand-object semantic priors.

  {"id":"liuSingleDualViewAdaptationEgocentric2024","abstract":"The pursuit of accurate 3D hand pose estimation stands as a keystone for understanding human activity in the realm of egocentric vision. The majority of existing estimation methods still rely on single-view images as input, leading to potential limitations, e.g., limited field-of-view and ambiguity in depth. To address these problems, adding another camera to better capture the shape of hands is a practical direction. However, existing multi-view hand pose estimation methods suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) Requiring multi-view annotations for training, which are expensive. 2) During testing, the model becomes inapplicable if camera parameters/layout are not the same as those used in training. In this paper, we propose a novel Singleto-Dual-view adaptation (S2DHand) solution that adapts a pre-trained single-view estimator to dual views. Compared with existing multi-view training methods, 1) our adaptation process is unsupervised, eliminating the need for multiview annotation. 2) Moreover, our method can handle arbitrary dual-view pairs with unknown camera parameters, making the model applicable to diverse camera settings. Specifically, S2DHand is built on certain stereo constraints, including pair-wise cross-view consensus and invariance of transformation between both views. These two stereo constraints are used in a complementary manner to generate pseudo-labels, allowing reliable adaptation. Evaluation results reveal that S2DHand achieves significant improvements on arbitrary camera pairs under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings, and outperforms existing adaptation methods with leading performance.

The parameters of the model are learned from data including the rest pose template, blend weights, pose-dependent blend shapes, identity-dependent blend shapes, and a regressor from vertices to joint locations. Unlike previous models, the pose-dependent blend shapes are a linear function of the elements of the pose rotation matrices. This simple formulation enables training the entire model from a relatively large number of aligned 3D meshes of different people in different poses. We quantitatively evaluate variants of SMPL using linear or dual-quaternion blend skinning and show that both are more accurate than a Blend-SCAPE model trained on the same data.

To capture high-frequency personalized details, we transform the 3D mesh into the frequency domain, and propose a novel frequency decomposition loss to supervise each frequency component. By leveraging such a coarse-to-fine scheme, hand details that correspond to the higher frequency domain can be preserved. In addition, the proposed network is scalable, and can stop the inference at any resolution level to accommodate different hardwares with varying computational powers. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method in terms of recovering personalized shape details, we introduce a new evaluation metric named Mean Signal-to-Noise Ratio (MSNR) to measure the signal-to-noise ratio of each mesh frequency component.

  {"id":"moonDeepHandMeshWeaklysupervisedDeep2020","abstract":"Human hands play a central role in interacting with other people and objects. For realistic replication of such hand motions, high-fidelity hand meshes have to be reconstructed. In this study, we firstly propose DeepHandMesh, a weakly-supervised deep encoder-decoder framework for high-fidelity hand mesh modeling. We design our system to be trained in an end-to-end and weakly-supervised manner; therefore, it does not require groundtruth meshes. Instead, it relies on weaker supervisions such as 3D joint coordinates and multi-view depth maps, which are easier to get than groundtruth meshes and do not dependent on the mesh topology. Although the proposed DeepHandMesh is trained in a weakly-supervised way, it provides significantly more realistic hand mesh than previous fully-supervised hand models.

Moreover, for applications in extended reality and gaming, real-time rendering is critical. We present the first neural-implicit approach to photo-realistically render hands in real-time. This is a challenging problem as hands are textured and undergo strong articulations with pose-dependent effects. However, we show that this aim is achievable through our carefully designed method. This includes training on a low-resolution rendering of a neural radiance field, together with a 3D-consistent super-resolution module and mesh-guided sampling and space canonicalization. We demonstrate a novel application of perceptual loss on the image space, which is critical for learning details accurately.

The main idea is to gain a human-centric model of a physical space (such as a kitchen) that captures (1) the primary spatial zones of interaction and (2) the likely activities they support. Our approach decomposes a space into a topological map derived from first-person activity, organizing an ego-video into a series of visits to the different zones.

  {"id":"nguyenS4NDModelingImages2022","abstract":"Visual data such as images and videos are typically modeled as discretizations of inherently continuous, multidimensional signals. Existing continuous-signal models attempt to exploit this fact by modeling the underlying signals of visual (e.g., image) data directly. However, these models have not yet been able to achieve competitive performance on practical vision tasks such as large-scale image and video classification. Building on a recent line of work on deep state space models (SSMs), we propose S4ND, a new multidimensional SSM layer that extends the continuous-signal modeling ability of SSMs to multidimensional data including images and videos. We show that S4ND can model large-scale visual data in $1$D, $2$D, and $3$D as continuous multidimensional signals and demonstrates strong performance by simply swapping Conv2D and self-attention layers with S4ND layers in existing state-of-the-art models. On ImageNet-1k, S4ND exceeds the performance of a Vision Transformer baseline by $1.5\\%$ when training with a $1$D sequence of patches, and matches ConvNeXt when modeling images in $2$D. For videos, S4ND improves on an inflated $3$D ConvNeXt in activity classification on HMDB-51 by $4\\%$. S4ND implicitly learns global, continuous convolutional kernels that are resolution invariant by construction, providing an inductive bias that enables generalization across multiple resolutions. By developing a simple bandlimiting modification to S4 to overcome aliasing, S4ND achieves strong zero-shot (unseen at training time) resolution performance, outperforming a baseline Conv2D by $40\\%$ on CIFAR-10 when trained on $8 \\times 8$ and tested on $32 \\times 32$ images.

Recognizing that blurry hand images include not only single 3D hands at a time step but also multiple hands along their motion trajectories, we design EBHNet to generate 3D hand sequences in motion. Moreover, to enable our EBHNet to predict 3D hands at novel, unsupervised time steps using a single shared module, we employ a Transformer-based module, temporal splitter, into EBHNet.

However, 3D hand reconstruction in the wild is challenging due to extreme lack of in-the-wild 3D hand datasets. Especially, when hands are in complex pose such as interacting hands, the problems like appearance similarity, self-handed occclusion and depth ambiguity make it more difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose AttentionHand, a novel method for text-driven controllable hand image generation. Since AttentionHand can generate various and numerous inthe-wild hand images well-aligned with 3D hand label, we can acquire a new 3D hand dataset, and can relieve the domain gap between indoor and outdoor scenes. Our method needs easy-to-use four modalities (i.e, an RGB image, a hand mesh image from 3D label, a bounding box, and a text prompt). These modalities are embedded into the latent space by the encoding phase. Then, through the text attention stage, hand-related tokens from the given text prompt are attended to highlight hand-related regions of the latent embedding. After the highlighted embedding is fed to the visual attention stage, hand-related regions in the embedding are attended by conditioning global and local hand mesh images with the diffusion-based pipeline. In the decoding phase, the final feature is decoded to new hand images, which are well-aligned with the given hand mesh image and text prompt. As a result, AttentionHand achieved state-of-the-art among text-to-hand image generation models, and the performance of 3D hand mesh reconstruction was improved by additionally training with hand images generated by AttentionHand.","author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Junho"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Kyeongbo"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Suk-Ju"}],"citation-key":"parkAttentionHandTextdrivenControllable","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"AttentionHand: Text-driven Controllable Hand Image Generation for 3D Hand Reconstruction in the Wild","type":"article-journal"},

Given their power to express human behavior, hands have been a very important, but challenging component of the human body. Currently, most of the state-of-the-art reconstruction and pose estimation methods rely on the low polygon MANO model. Apart from its low polygon count, MANO model was trained with only 31 adult subjects, which not only limits its expressive power but also imposes unnecessary shape reconstruction constraints on pose estimation methods. Moreover, hand appearance remains almost unexplored and neglected from the majority of hand reconstruction methods. In this work, we propose \"Handy\", a large-scale model of the human hand, modeling both shape and appearance composed of over 1200 subjects which we make publicly available for the benefit of the research community. In contrast to current models, our proposed hand model was trained on a dataset with large diversity in age, gender, and ethnicity, which tackles the limitations of MANO and accurately reconstructs out-of-distribution samples. In order to create a high quality texture model, we trained a powerful GAN, which preserves high frequency details and is able to generate high resolution hand textures. To showcase the capabilities of the proposed model, we built a synthetic dataset of textured hands and trained a hand pose estimation network to reconstruct both the shape and appearance from single images. As it is demonstrated in an extensive series of quantitative as well as qualitative experiments, our model proves to be robust against the state-of-the-art and realistically captures the 3D hand shape and pose along with a high frequency detailed texture even in adverse \"in-the-wild\" conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Potamias","given":"Rolandos Alexandros"},{"family":"Ploumpis","given":"Stylianos"},{"family":"Moschoglou","given":"Stylianos"},{"family":"Triantafyllou","given":"Vasileios"},{"family":"Zafeiriou","given":"Stefanos"}],"citation-key":"potamiasHandyHighFidelity2023","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"4670-4680","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"Handy: Towards a High Fidelity 3D Hand Shape and Appearance Model","title-short":"Handy","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Potamias_Handy_Towards_a_High_Fidelity_3D_Hand_Shape_and_Appearance_CVPR_2023_paper.html"},

  {"id":"prakash3DReconstructionObjects2024","abstract":"Prior works for reconstructing hand-held objects from a single image train models on images paired with 3D shapes. Such data is challenging to gather in the real world at scale. Consequently, these approaches do not generalize well when presented with novel objects in in-the-wild settings. While 3D supervision is a major bottleneck, there is an abundance of a) in-the-wild raw video data showing hand-object interactions and b) synthetic 3D shape collections. In this paper, we propose modules to leverage 3D supervision from these sources to scale up the learning of models for reconstructing hand-held objects.

Models for predicting 3D from a single image often work with crops around the object of interest and ignore the location of the object in the camera's field of view.

To mitigate this ambiguity, we propose Intrinsics-Aware Positional Encoding (KPE), which incorporates information about the location of crops in the image and camera intrinsics.

Although several 3D hand reconstruction approaches leverage hand models as a strong prior to resolve ambiguities and achieve more robust results, most existing models account only for the hand shape and poses and do not model the texture. To ﬁll this gap, in this work we present HTML, the ﬁrst parametric texture model of human hands. Our model spans several dimensions of hand appearance variability (e.g., related to gender, ethnicity, or age) and only requires a commodity camera for data acquisition. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our appearance model can be used to tackle a range of challenging problems such as 3D hand reconstruction from a single monocular image. Furthermore, our appearance model can be used to deﬁne a neural rendering layer that enables training with a selfsupervised photometric loss.

  {"id":"qiDiverse3DHand2023","abstract":"Predicting natural and diverse 3D hand gestures from the upper body dynamics is a practical yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Previous works usually overlook the asymmetric motions between two hands and generate two hands in a holistic manner, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we introduce a novel bilateral hand disentanglement based two-stage 3D hand generation method to achieve natural and diverse 3D hand prediction from body dynamics. In the first stage, we intend to generate natural hand gestures by two hand-disentanglement branches. Considering the asymmetric gestures and motions of two hands, we introduce a Spatial-Residual Memory (SRM) module to model spatial interaction between the body and each hand by residual learning. To enhance the coordination of two hand motions wrt. body dynamics holistically, we then present a Temporal-Motion Memory (TMM) module. TMM can effectively model the temporal association between body dynamics and two hand motions. The second stage is built upon the insight that 3D hand predictions should be non-deterministic given the sequential body postures. Thus, we further diversify our 3D hand predictions based on the initial output from the stage one. Concretely, we propose a Prototypical-Memory Sampling Strategy (PSS) to generate the non-deterministic hand gestures by gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.

In this paper, we propose a neural rendering and pose estimation system for hand-object interaction from sparse views, which can also enable 3D hand-object interaction editing. We share the inspiration from recent scene understanding work that shows a scene specific model built beforehand can significantly improve and unblock vision tasks especially when inputs are sparse, and extend it to the dynamic hand-object interaction scenario and propose to solve the problem in two stages. We first learn the shape and appearance prior knowledge of hands and objects separately with the neural representation at the offline stage. During the online stage, we design a rendering-based joint model fitting framework to understand the dynamic hand-object interaction with the pre-built hand and object models as well as interaction priors, which thereby overcomes penetration and separation issues between hand and object and also enables novel view synthesis. In order to get stable contact during the hand-object interaction process in a sequence, we propose a stable contact loss to make the contact region to be consistent.

  {"id":"romeroEmbodiedHandsModeling2017","abstract":"Humans move their hands and bodies together to communicate and solve tasks. Capturing and replicating such coordinated activity is critical for virtual characters that behave realistically. Surprisingly, most methods treat the 3D modeling and tracking of bodies and hands separately. Here we formulate a model of hands and bodies interacting together and fit it to full-body 4D sequences. When scanning or capturing the full body in 3D, hands are small and often partially occluded, making their shape and pose hard to recover. To cope with low-resolution, occlusion, and noise, we develop a new model called MANO (hand Model with Articulated and Non-rigid defOrmations). MANO is learned from around 1000 high-resolution 3D scans of hands of 31 subjects in a wide variety of hand poses. The model is realistic, low-dimensional, captures non-rigid shape changes with pose, is compatible with standard graphics packages, and can fit any human hand. MANO provides a compact mapping from hand poses to pose blend shape corrections and a linear manifold of pose synergies. We attach MANO to a standard parameterized 3D body shape model (SMPL), resulting in a fully articulated body and hand model (SMPL+H). We illustrate SMPL+H by fitting complex, natural, activities of subjects captured with a 4D scanner. The fitting is fully automatic and results in full body models that move naturally with detailed hand motions and a realism not seen before in full body performance capture.

Methodology/Principal Findings Hand movement kinematics were measured during reaching for and grasping movements towards two objects (stimuli): a bottle with an ordinary cylindrical shape and a bottle with a concave constriction. The effects of the stimuli's weight (half full or completely full of water) and the end-goals (pouring, moving) of the action were also assessed. Analysis of key kinematic landmarks measured during reaching movements indicate that object affordance facilitates the end-goal of the action regardless of accuracy constraints. Furthermore, the placement of individual digits at contact is modulated by the shape of the object and the end-goal of the action.

Observing the unique characteristics of hand poses, we temporally factorize hand modeling and represent each joint by its short-term trajectories. This factorized pose representation combined with sparse RGB samples is remarkably efficient and highly accurate. Unimodal HandFormer with only hand poses outperforms existing skeleton-based methods at 5\n fewer FLOPs.

Experiments show that the resulting model can predict the effects of hand-object interactions well, with strong generalization particularly to translation, stretching, and squeezing interactions of unseen objects in unseen environments. Further, CoSHAND can be sampled many times to predict multiple possible effects, modeling the uncertainty of forces in the interaction/environment.

To go beyond these limitations and spur further research, we introduce the SHOWMe dataset which consists of 96 videos, annotated with real and detailed hand-object 3D textured meshes. Following recent work, we consider a rigid hand-object scenario, in which the pose of the hand with respect to the object remains constant during the whole video sequence. This assumption allows us to register sub-millimetre-precise groundtruth 3D scans to the image sequences in SHOWMe. Although simpler, this hypothesis makes sense in terms of applications where the required accuracy and level of detail is important eg., object hand-over in human-robot collaboration, object scanning, or manipulation and contact point analysis. Importantly, the rigidity of the hand-object systems allows to tackle video-based 3D reconstruction of unknown hand-held objects using a 2-stage pipeline consisting of a rigid registration step followed by a multi-view reconstruction (MVR) part. We carefully evaluate a set of non-trivial baselines for these two stages and show that it is possible to achieve promising object-agnostic 3D hand-object reconstructions employing an SfM toolbox or a hand pose estimator to recover the rigid transforms and off-the-shelf MVR algorithms.

  {"id":"taheriGRABDatasetWholeBody2020","abstract":"Training computers to understand, model, and synthesize human grasping requires a rich dataset containing complex 3D object shapes, detailed contact information, hand pose and shape, and the 3D body motion over time. While “grasping” is commonly thought of as a single hand stably lifting an object, we capture the motion of the entire body and adopt the generalized notion of “whole-body grasps”. Thus, we collect a new dataset, called GRAB (GRasping Actions with Bodies), of whole-body grasps, containing full 3D shape and pose sequences of 10 subjects interacting with 51 everyday objects of varying shape and size. Given MoCap markers, we fit the full 3D body shape and pose, including the articulated face and hands, as well as the 3D object pose.

  {"id":"tangPromptingFutureDriven","abstract":"Hand motion prediction from both first- and third-person perspectives is vital for enhancing user experience in AR/VR and ensuring safe remote robotic arm control. Previous works typically focus on predicting hand motion trajectories or human body motion, with direct hand motion prediction remaining largely unexplored - despite the additional challenges posed by compact skeleton size. To address this, we propose a prompt-based Future Driven Diffusion Model (PromptFDDM) for predicting hand motion with guidance and prompts. Specifically, we develop a Spatial-Temporal Extractor Network (STEN) to predict hand motion with guidance, a Ground Truth Extractor Network (GTEN), and a Reference Data Generator Network (RDGN), which extract ground truth and substitute future data with generated reference data, respectively, to guide STEN. Additionally, interactive prompts generated from observed motions further enhance model performance. Experimental results on the FPHA and HO3D datasets demonstrate that the proposed PromptFDDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both first- and third-person perspectives.","author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Bowen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Kaihao"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Wenhan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hongdong"}],"citation-key":"tangPromptingFutureDriven","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Prompting Future Driven Diffusion Model for Hand Motion Prediction","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"tevetHumanMotionDiffusion2022","abstract":"Natural and expressive human motion generation is the holy grail of computer animation. It is a challenging task, due to the diversity of possible motion, human perceptual sensitivity to it, and the difficulty of accurately describing it. Therefore, current generative solutions are either low-quality or limited in expressiveness. Diffusion models, which have already shown remarkable generative capabilities in other domains, are promising candidates for human motion due to their many-to-many nature, but they tend to be resource hungry and hard to control. In this paper, we introduce Motion Diffusion Model (MDM), a carefully adapted classifier-free diffusion-based generative model for the human motion domain. MDM is transformer-based, combining insights from motion generation literature. A notable design-choice is the prediction of the sample, rather than the noise, in each diffusion step. This facilitates the use of established geometric losses on the locations and velocities of the motion, such as the foot contact loss. As we demonstrate, MDM is a generic approach, enabling different modes of conditioning, and different generation tasks. We show that our model is trained with lightweight resources and yet achieves state-of-the-art results on leading benchmarks for text-to-motion and action-to-motion. https://guytevet.github.io/mdm-page/ .","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tevet","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Raab","given":"Sigal"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Shafir","given":"Yonatan"},{"family":"Cohen-Or","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Bermano","given":"Amit H."}],"citation-key":"tevetHumanMotionDiffusion2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2209.14916","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2209.14916","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Human Motion Diffusion Model","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14916"},

Previous work typically divided the task into two stages: given a cropped image of the hand, predict meshes in relative coordinates, followed by lifting these predictions into camera space in a separate and independent stage, often resulting in the loss of valuable contextual and scale information. To prevent the loss of these cues, we propose unifying these two stages into an end-to-end solution that addresses the 2D-3D correspondence problem. This solution enables backpropagation from camera space outputs to the rest of the network through a new differentiable global positioning module.

Our key idea is to collaborate with estimated hand features to guide the object global pose estimation, and then optimize the deformation process of the object by analyzing the relationship between the hand and the object.

However, existing learning-based methods focus more on contact with rigid ones from monocular images. When adopting them for nonrigid contact, a major problem is that the existing contact representation is restricted by the geometry of the object. Consequently, contact neighborhoods are stored in an unordered manner and contact features are difficult to align with image cues. At the core of our approach lies a novel hand-object contact representation called RUPs (Region Unwrapping Profiles), which unwrap the roughly estimated hand-object surfaces as multiple high-resolution 2D regional profiles. The region grouping strategy is consistent with the hand kinematic bone division because they are the primitive initiators for a composite contact pattern. Based on this representation, our Regional Unwrapping Transformer (RUFormer) learns the correlation priors across regions from monocular inputs and predicts corresponding contact and deformed transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can robustly estimate the deformed degrees and deformed transformations, which make it suitable for both nonrigid and rigid contact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zimeng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shiying"},{"family":"Zuo","given":"Binghui"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yangang"}],"citation-key":"xieNonrigidObjectContact2023","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"9342-9351","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"Nonrigid Object Contact Estimation With Regional Unwrapping Transformer","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Xie_Nonrigid_Object_Contact_Estimation_With_Regional_Unwrapping_Transformer_ICCV_2023_paper.html"},

Although existing multi-view hand reconstruction methods achieve remarkable accuracy, they typically come with an intensive computational burden that hinders real-time inference. To this end, we propose MLPHand, a novel method designed for real-time multi-view single hand reconstruction. MLP Hand consists of two primary modules: (1) a lightweight MLP-based Skeleton2Mesh model that efficiently recovers hand meshes from hand skeletons, and (2) a multi-view geometry feature fusion prediction module that enhances the Skeleton2Mesh model with detailed geometric information from multiple views.

Point is a natural form of 3D information and an ideal medium for fusing features across views, as it has different projections on different views. Our method is thus in light of a simple yet effective idea, that a complex 3D hand mesh can be represented by a set of 3D points that 1) are embedded in the multi-view stereo, 2) carry features from the multi-view images, and 3) encircle the hand. To leverage the power of points, we design two operations: point-based feature fusion and cross-set point attention mechanism.

However, most methods are currently limited to either text- or image-conditioned generation for synthesizing an entire image, texture transfer or inserting objects into a user-specified region. In contrast, in this work we focus on synthesizing complex interactions (i.e., an articulated hand) with a given object. Given an RGB image of an object, we aim to hallucinate plausible images of a human hand interacting with it. We propose a two step generative approach that leverages a LayoutNet that samples an articulation-agnostic hand-object-interaction layout, and a ContentNet that synthesizes images of a hand grasping the object given the predicted layout. Both are built on top of a large-scale pretrained diffusion model to make use of its latent representation. Compared to baselines, the proposed method is shown to generalize better to novel objects and perform surprisingly well on out-of-distribution in-the-wild scenes.

To obtain accurate 3D, we augment the multi-view signals with generic data-driven priors to guide reconstruction.

Existing methods mainly learn an entangled representation to encode two interacting hands, which are incredibly fragile to impaired interaction, such as truncated hands, separate hands, or external occlusion. This paper presents ACR (Attention Collaboration-based Regressor), which makes the first attempt to reconstruct hands in arbitrary scenarios. To achieve this, ACR explicitly mitigates interdependencies between hands and between parts by leveraging center and part-based attention for feature extraction. However, reducing interdependence helps release the input constraint while weakening the mutual reasoning about reconstructing the interacting hands. Thus, based on center attention, ACR also learns cross-hand prior that handle the interacting hands better. We evaluate our method on various types of hand reconstruction datasets.

  {"id":"zhengHaMuCoHandPose2023","abstract":"Recent advancements in 3D hand pose estimation have shown promising results, but its effectiveness has primarily relied on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, the creation of which is a laborious and costly process. To alleviate the label-hungry limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning framework, HaMuCo, that learns a single view hand pose estimator from multi-view pseudo 2D labels. However, one of the main challenges of self-supervised learning is the presence of noisy labels and the \"groupthink\" effect from multiple views. To overcome these issues, we introduce a cross-view interaction network that distills the single view estimator by utilizing the cross-view correlated features and enforcing multi-view consistency to achieve collaborative learning. Both the single view estimator and the cross-view interaction network are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on multi-view self-supervised hand pose estimation. Furthermore, the proposed cross-view interaction network can also be applied to hand pose estimation from multi-view input and outperforms previous methods under same settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xiaozheng"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Zhou"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Pengfei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jingyu"}],"citation-key":"zhengHaMuCoHandPose2023","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"20763-20773","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"HaMuCo: Hand Pose Estimation via Multiview Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning","title-short":"HaMuCo","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zheng_HaMuCo_Hand_Pose_Estimation_via_Multiview_Collaborative_Self-Supervised_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html"},
  {"id":"zhouGEARSLocalGeometryaware2024","abstract":"Generating realistic hand motion sequences in interaction with objects has gained increasing attention with the growing interest in digital humans. Prior work has illustrated the effectiveness of employing occupancy-based or distance-based virtual sensors to extract hand-object interaction features. Nonetheless these methods show limited generalizability across object categories shapes and sizes. We hypothesize that this is due to two reasons: 1) the limited expressiveness of employed virtual sensors and 2) scarcity of available training data. To tackle this challenge we introduce a novel joint-centered sensor designed to reason about local object geometry near potential interaction regions. The sensor queries for object surface points in the neighbourhood of each hand joint. As an important step towards mitigating the learning complexity we transform the points from global frame to hand template frame and use a shared module to process sensor features of each individual joint. This is followed by a spatio-temporal transformer network aimed at capturing correlation among the joints in different dimensions. Moreover we devise simple heuristic rules to augment the limited training sequences with vast static hand grasping samples. This leads to a broader spectrum of grasping types observed during training in turn enhancing our model's generalization capability. We evaluate on two public datasets GRAB and InterCap where our method shows superiority over baselines both quantitatively and perceptually.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Keyang"},{"family":"Bhatnagar","given":"Bharat Lal"},{"family":"Lenssen","given":"Jan Eric"},{"family":"Pons-Moll","given":"Gerard"}],"citation-key":"zhouGEARSLocalGeometryaware2024","event-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"20634-20643","source":"openaccess.thecvf.com","title":"GEARS: Local Geometry-aware Hand-object Interaction Synthesis","title-short":"GEARS","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Zhou_GEARS_Local_Geometry-aware_Hand-object_Interaction_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.html"},

  {"id":"zhouMonocularRealTimeHand2020a","abstract":"We present a novel method for monocular hand shape and pose estimation at unprecedented runtime performance of 100fps and at state-of-the-art accuracy. This is enabled by a new learning based architecture designed such that it can make use of all the sources of available hand training data: image data with either 2D or 3D annotations, as well as stand-alone 3D animations without corresponding image data. It features a 3D hand joint detection module and an inverse kinematics module which regresses not only 3D joint positions but also maps them to joint rotations in a single feed-forward pass. This output makes the method more directly usable for applications in computer vision and graphics compared to only regressing 3D joint positions. We demonstrate that our architectural design leads to a signiﬁcant quantitative and qualitative improvement over the state of the art on several challenging benchmarks.

  {"id":"zhouSimpleBaselineEfficient2024","abstract":"Hand mesh reconstruction has attracted considerable attention in recent years with various approaches and techniques being proposed. Some of these methods incorporate complex components and designs which while effective may complicate the model and hinder efficiency. In this paper we decompose the mesh decoder into token generator and mesh regressor. Through extensive ablation experiments we found that the token generator should select discriminating and representative points while the mesh regressor needs to upsample sparse keypoints into dense meshes in multiple stages. Given these functionalities we can achieve high performance with minimal computational resources. Based on this observation we propose a simple yet effective baseline that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while maintaining real-time efficiency. Our method outperforms existing solutions achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across multiple datasets. On the FreiHAND dataset our approach produced a PA-MPJPE of 5.8mm and a PA-MPVPE of 6.1mm. Similarly on the DexYCB dataset we observed a PA-MPJPE of 5.5mm and a PA-MPVPE of 5.5mm. As for performance speed our method reached up to 33 frames per second (fps) when using HRNet and up to 70 fps when employing FastViT-MA36.

  {"id":"zuoReconstructingInteractingHands2023","abstract":"Reconstructing interacting hands from monocular images is indispensable in AR/VR applications. Most existing solutions rely on the accurate localization of each skeleton joint. However, these methods tend to be unreliable due to the severe occlusion and confusing similarity among adjacent hand parts. This also defies human perception because humans can quickly imitate an interaction pattern without localizing all joints. Our key idea is to first construct a two-hand interaction prior and recast the interaction reconstruction task as the conditional sampling from the prior. To expand more interaction states, a large-scale multimodal dataset with physical plausibility is proposed. Then a VAE is trained to further condense these interaction patterns as latent codes in a prior distribution. When looking for image cues that contribute to interaction prior sampling, we propose the interaction adjacency heatmap (IAH). Compared with a joint-wise heatmap for localization, IAH assigns denser visible features to those invisible joints. Compared with an all-in-one visible heatmap, it provides more fine-grained local interaction information in each interaction region. Finally, the correlations between the extracted features and corresponding interaction codes are linked by the ViT module. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness of this framework. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github. com/binghui-z/InterPrior_pytorch.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuo","given":"Binghui"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zimeng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Wenqian"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Zhou"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yangang"}],"citation-key":"zuoReconstructingInteractingHands2023","container-title":"2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","DOI":"10.1109/ICCV51070.2023.00831","event-place":"Paris, France","event-title":"2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","ISBN":"9798350307184","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","page":"9020-9030","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Paris, France","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reconstructing Interacting Hands with Interaction Prior from Monocular Images","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10378019/"}
